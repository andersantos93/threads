                A thread is something you post that appears on your profile and
                in a feed. It can include short pieces of text, links, photos,
                videos or any combination of them. Who can see your thread
                follows your profile's privacy setting.

                To mention someone on Threads, when starting a new thread or
                replying to a thread, type @[person's username]. Note: Don't
                include any spaces between the @ symbol and the username
                (example: @username). You can also mention someone in a new post
                on Threads by clicking Mention at the top of their profile.

                Tagging a topic in your post allows others on Threads to
                discover your post and other posts associated with that topic in
                real time. You can include up to 1 topic per post.

                Automatic alt text uses object recognition technology to provide
                a visual description of photos and videos for people with visual
                impairments. You can replace this text to provide a better
                description of a post that includes a photo or video. Keep in
                mind that this description will only be read if someone is using
                a screen reader to access Threads.

                When you create organic branded content on Threads, our branded
                content policies require that you use the paid partnership tool
                to indicate when a commercial relationship has influenced the
                post. You should also mention the brand you are working with in
                the post.
